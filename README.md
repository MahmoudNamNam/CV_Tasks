#### **Computer Vision Overview**
- Purpose:
  - Understand images, animations, videos, and emotions.
  - Extract useful information from single or multiple images.

#### **Machine/Deep Learning Model Workflow**
1. **Import Libraries**
   - Use libraries to build models.
2. **Import Dataset**
   - Examples: CT scans, ultrasound, satellite images.
3. **Data Preparation**
   - Split into training and testing datasets.
4. **Data Processing**
   - Apply processing techniques like filters.
5. **Build Model**
   - Design and structure the model.
6. **Compile Model**
   - Prepare the model for execution.
7. **Project Results**
   - Output the results of the model.

#### **Data Imputation vs. Data Augmentation**
- **Data Imputation**
  - Handles missing data by filling pixel gaps.
  - Example: Predicting missing pixel values based on surrounding data.
- **Data Augmentation**
  - Expands datasets by transforming existing data.
  - Example: Flipping images, changing brightness, or adding noise.

#### **Examples of Image Processing in Real Life**
- Brightness adjustments.
- Noise removal.
- Filtering.
- Histogram equalization.
- Color normalization.

#### **Processes in Computer Vision**
1. **Segmentation**
   - Divides images into meaningful parts at the pixel level.
2. **Detection**
   - Locates objects within an image or video.
3. **Recognition**
   - Identifies and classifies detected objects into predefined categories.
   - Note: Detection precedes recognition.
4. **Classification**
   - Binary Classification: Classifies into two groups (e.g., cat vs. dog).
   - Multi-class Classification: Classifies into more than two categories.
